# python-project-Harinder-Singh-au9
AttainU python project Repository

Introduction--

Hello, my name is Harinder singh, I am from Delhi. I am doing full stack web development course at AttainU. For my python project I have created a console app “Harry’s Kitchen” which is similar to Swiggy and other food ordering apps.

What is the project?
#### Features:
1. This system has tie-up with restaurants where each restaurant has a menu, with all its servable items with their individual price.
2. Each restaurant has a maximum processing capacity of items at any given time. Beyond that, it won't accept any further item requests until items which are in processing are completed.
3. Each restaurant takes some time to prepare and dispatch food. Once an item is prepared and dispatched, it notifies the system about it. After which, it can take new request.
4. Once one restaurant can be selected based on restaurant selection strategy for one order.
5. Order is accepted from the customer only if all the items can be fulfilled by one selected restaurant.
#### Requirements:
1. Onboard new restaurant with its menu and item processing capacity.
2. Restaurant should be able to change its menu or update price.
3. Customer should be able to place an order by giving items.
4. Implement one restaurant selection strategy. (Eg.: select available restaurant which offers the lowest price for that order item). There should be an option of giving different strategies in future.
5. System should be able to keep track of all items served by each restaurant.

motivation----
It’s a real life application and I decided to make a clone of if without using GUI and main reason to choose this project because its working is very broad and we can implement as many functions as we want. Since, it’s a lengthy project , learning is also broad.


The target of the project ---
The target of the project was very simple to create the working functions for both as a User side and for working as the Restaurants side.

Python packages and libraries used—
•	Sqlite 3 (for storing data in runtime)
•	Date-time
•	Requests
•	Sys
•	clx.xme (to use API for SMS) 


Technologies used---
•	Python 3.8
•	Sqlite 3

What are the issue we faced?
Flow was bit difficult, rest I love to handle the challenges.

What improvement can be done on the project?
There are many things which can be added like tracking and location detection.
